/*
| PHPUnit process isolation (`RunInSeparateProcess`) renders a child script that
| requires Composer autoload only when PHPUNIT_COMPOSER_INSTALL is defined.
| Composer's phpunit binary sets this; Pest's entrypoint does not — define it here
| so isolated tests work under `./vendor/bin/pest` and `pest --mutate`.
|
| Mutation testing:
| - `--path` is source to mutate (e.g. `app/Services/Logic`), not the test directory.
| - Optional trailing paths limit which tests run for the initial coverage pass, e.g.
|   `pest --mutate --path=app/Services/Logic tests/Unit/Services/Logic`.
| - `--everything --covered-only` with no `--path` often yields zero mutations (no files
|   to intersect with coverage); use `--everything` alone or add explicit `--path=app`.
| - Avoid `--parallel` with `--mutate`: the Parallel plugin still sees `--parallel` on the
|   real argv while coverage is merged from workers, so line→test mapping is missing and
|   Pest reports UNCOVERED for mutants even when tests exist. Run `pest --mutate` without
|   `--parallel` so the initial `--coverage-php` pass stays single-process and each mutant
|   gets correct test filters.
| - Scoped runs finish the initial suite in a few seconds; Pest’s per-mutant timeout is
|   derived from that duration (~initial + 5s), which is too low for Laravel bootstrap.
|   `scripts/patch-pest-mutate-subprocess.php` (composer post-autoload-dump) floors the
|   timeout (default floor 240s; override with `PEST_MUTATION_TIMEOUT_FLOOR_SECONDS`).
| - If every mutant shows `t`, run `php scripts/patch-pest-mutate-subprocess.php` or
|   `composer dump-autoload` (patch runs before `package:discover` so it still applies when
|   discover fails).
| - `tests/bootstrap.php` skips MySQL lock + DROP/CREATE when `PEST_MUTATION_TESTING` is set
|   (mutant children); otherwise they block on the same `flock` as the parent and every mutant times out (`t`).
| - Two local Pest runs on the same default DB block each other on the MySQL bootstrap lock.
|   Use a separate schema: `DB_DATABASE=testing1 ./vendor/bin/pest …` (MySQL user needs
|   CREATE DATABASE; bootstrap creates the schema if missing).

| Expectations
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------

| When you're writing tests, you often need to check that values meet certain conditions. The

| to assert different things. Of course, you may extend the Expectation API at any time.

| Functions

| project that you don't want to repeat in every file. Here you can also expose helpers as
| global functions to help you to reduce the number of lines of code in your test files.
